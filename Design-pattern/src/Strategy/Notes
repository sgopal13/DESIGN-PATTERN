Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern.
 We define multiple algorithms and let client application pass the algorithm to be used as a parameter.

One of the best example of strategy pattern is Collections.sort() method that takes Comparator parameter. 
Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting sorted in different ways.

For our example, we will try to implement a simple Shopping Cart where we have two payment strategies – using Credit Card or using PayPal.

First of all we will create the interface for our strategy pattern example, in our case to pay the amount passed as argument.
